# Configuration for testing dynamics model with manual actions

# Checkpoint paths
checkpoints:
  tokenizer: log/genie-tokenizer/version_1/checkpoints/epoch=13-step=6622.ckpt
  # Use either world_ckpt (combined) or both latent_action_ckpt and dynamics_ckpt
  # If latent_action_ckpt and dynamics_ckpt are the same path, it will be treated as a combined checkpoint
  world_ckpt: null  # Path to combined world checkpoint (if available)
  latent_action_ckpt: log/genie-action/version_0/checkpoints/epoch=31-step=7584.ckpt
  dynamics_ckpt: log/genie-action/version_0/checkpoints/epoch=31-step=7584.ckpt  # Same as latent_action_ckpt = combined checkpoint

# Generation settings
generation:
  actions: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Action sequence to test (comma-separated or list)
  steps_per_frame: 25  # MaskGIT sampling steps per frame
  frames_per_action: 15  # Number of times to repeat each generated frame (15 = 1 second at 15fps)
  output: output.mp4  # Output video path
  fps: 15  # Frames per second for output video

# Optional: initial frame
# Can be either:
# - Path to an image file (e.g., "path/to/frame.png")
# - Path to a video file (e.g., "data/Ninja/train/0000.mp4") - will use first frame
initial_frame: data/Ninja/train/0000.mp4  # Path to initial frame image or video (optional, uses black frame if null)

# Device settings
device: cuda  # cuda or cpu
